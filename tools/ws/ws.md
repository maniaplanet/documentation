The Maniaplanet Web Services is the public API that everyone can use to retrieve various information about the game, the players, the rankings, etc. You can use that API to build all sorts of applications.

NADEO distributes a [PHP SDK (distributed on github and packagist)](https://github.com/maniaplanet/maniaplanet-ws-sdk), but any HTTP capable language can be used. 

OAuth2 for ManiaPlanet is available (to allow users to login to your website using their ManiaPlanet account), it's called [ManiaConnect](maniaconnect).

*You can get help on the [ManiaPlanet Web Services forum](http://forum.maniaplanet.com/viewforum.php?f=282).*
